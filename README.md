# SpriteGameOpenTk
A tiny, teaching-oriented sprite animation game built with OpenTK (OpenGL 3.3) and C#.It demonstrates window creation, shader compilation, VAO/VBO setup, orthographic projection, keyboard input, texture atlas sampling, and a simple frame-based animator that keeps the last frame visible when input stops.
